<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![IAE Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://imgur.com/z0ETKXQ.png)

The Intersect Admin Editor was made for my personal use, but I decided to share it as it may be userfull for some people until the official one @jcsnider is working on is released. This is still a work in progress and not all things  are functional at this moment (game objects tab page). The application folder must be placed in the same directory that contains the **Client and Editor**.
